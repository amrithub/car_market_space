# **Introduction**
This is a market web application for buyers and sellers of cars. A user can register oneself and then buy a car posted by other users. Also, a user can post an advertisement of his/her car. In addition, non-registered users can see the car lists and the car details.

# **Motivation/Objective**
Even though we have so many market place applications like Ebay, Amazon and gumtree, Ebay and Amazon are not suitable for car sales. Also, people can post car advertisements in gumtree which we can see quite often, but, they can't make the payment via gumtree. So, I decided to design a marketplace application so that it is specialized in cars only and a user can also buy the car online by making online payment.
